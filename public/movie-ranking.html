<h3>TRON</h3>
<p>
  An Sci Fi movie where the main character gets digitized into a computer world
  of programs. The movie was far ahead of its time not in only in concept but
  also film techniques. The soundtrack is provided by Wendy Carlos which gives
  the computer world an extra dimension.

<h3>5 Seconds per Centimeter</h3>

  A very well drawn and immersive anime, where the story is divided in 3 parts.
  It tells about young love and the deep yearning and feeling of loss when the 2
  main characters are separated and never see each other again. The director and
  writer is Makoto Shinka, who's eye for perfection lifts this anime to greater
  hights. Music by Tenmon.

  is wife moves to his home town looking for work. He starts a job as nokanshi,
